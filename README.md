# Inventory-App

READ ME Project 3


    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why       were your designs successful?
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?



1)The goal is to create an application which allows a company to track and manage inventory controls from their devices. There is to be a login screen with two databases (one for login info and the other for inventory) as well as a view which lists each item. 

2) The user needed the design to be as simple as possible. I made this as easy as I could by including a very easily navigable app with large buttons and very little confusion. Also implementations in place programatically to PREVENT users from making mistakes. My screens are successful because a user doesn't have to guess to accomplish their goals.

3) When I first began this project, I think I had a much more code-focused goal. As my work progessed, I began to consider the end user and their experiences with the application on a much higher point. This will absolutely be useful in the future, even if I may not be creating end-user products.

4) I went through a lot of database testing. It took me a while to get everything just right, but I was able to work my way there by inserting test data into the database. There are tools you can use to access these SQL DBs which will show you the table you've created along with the data. 

5) I had overcome a lot of blindspots in regards to user experience. Throughout the course (and this project) I found the Android Design guidelines to be super helpful in each stage (planning, development, and launch) of this apps creation. 

6) I was really proud of myself for my database work. It was the aspect that frightened me the most about this project, but I was able to overcome the various challenges involved in instantiating an SQL database programatically through a phone! Seeing how smoothly this works made me feel pretty nice about my progress in this course.
